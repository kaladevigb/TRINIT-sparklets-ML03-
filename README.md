Data Preprocessing:

Convert the byte-array format images into a usable format (e.g., PNG or JPEG).
Normalize the images since they are standardized to 224x224 pixels.
Split the data using train.csv, test.csv, and valid.csv for training, testing, and validation purposes.

Model Development:

Use a pre-trained model like CLIP from OpenAI as a starting point, which can understand both visual and textual data.
Implement an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder processes the images, and the decoder generates the captions.
Train the model using the captions from train.csv to learn the correlation between the images and their respective captions
.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate your model using the BLEU score by comparing the generated captions against the reference captions in test.csv.
Fine-tune the model with valid.csv to improve its performance based on the BLEU score feedback.
Deployment:
For a low-code deployment, consider using frameworks like Streamlit or Gradio, which are user-friendly and require minimal setup.
For a more extensive deployment, use Django or Flask to create a full-fledged web application with more control over the backend and frontend.

Web-App Development:

Create an interactive interface where users can upload remote sensing images and receive captions.
Ensure that the web app can handle the unique characteristics of remote sensing images and provide accurate captions.
Testing and Iteration:
Test the web app with users to gather feedback.
Iterate on the model and the app based on user feedback to enhance the overall performance and user experience.
